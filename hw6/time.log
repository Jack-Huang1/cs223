I discussed my solution with: Benjamin Rewis, Daniel Lee, Varsha Raghavan

Biggest Challenge: One of the biggest challenges I had for this p-set was fixing all the memory issues with my program because not only was it difficult following the algorithm(s) as they ran, but it was also really hard keeping track of all the different structs and variables that were being used/changed. Not only that, but with so many different combinations of flag inputs and rooms to be inserted, there were a lot of different cases that had to be accounted for, which was tedious to cover. Another issue I had during this p-set was properly implementing the min heap and properly managing its memory, especially when implementing it in Fire where the dictionary would use the same room variables so I had to be careful not to over-free.
