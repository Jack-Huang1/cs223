I discussed my solution with: Benjamin Rewis

Biggest Challenge: The biggest challenge I had for this p-set was definitely implementing AVL into my Cloud program. It was pretty simple adjusting AVLtree.c to work with strings instead of integers, but I had a lot of issues implementing AVL because 1) I didn't fully separate AVL functions with regular btree functions and 2) some of the ways I worked with the AVL tree had memory issues or got stuck in an infinite loop because I assumed the AVLtree's functions worked the same way as the btree's. When first debugging AVL, it was hard figuring out where exactly my problems were coming from because it was hard to trace the memory issues, but after dissecting my code and debugging it piece by piece I found my mistakes and correctly them appropriately.
